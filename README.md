## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

Students currently face challenges in reporting and recovering lost items due to:
- Lack of a centralized system
- Scattered communication via WhatsApp, notice boards, etc.
- No real-time updates
- Confusion and inefficiency in item recovery

### Example:  
> Rahul loses his calculator and asks around, checks notice boards, and posts in class groupsâ€”but never hears back. There's no way for him to know if someone found it.

## ðŸ’¡ Our Solution

ComplainIQ provides a single, unified platform to:
- Instantly post and view lost-and-found reports
- Engage with other students for faster recovery
- Let admins manage reports effectively

### Example:
